# General Info

In today's digital age, people often face challenges in finding specific items they desire due to the lack of comprehensive and easily accessible data on the internet. This problem becomes even more challenging when individuals have a specific item in mind but are uncertain about its location or where to find it. Therefore, there is a need for a solution that enables users to upload a picture of the desired item and obtain information about exact items.
The project developed leverages image recognition and data integration techniques to provide users with a platform to find exact items or recommend similar ones and locate shops or locations where they are available.

# Technologies Used
